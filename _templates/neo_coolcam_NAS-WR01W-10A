First time lashing with tasmota needs soldering.

Attention: Recent orders (as of 2022-10) ship this plug with Beken BK7321T chipset instead of ESP8266. These will not work with Tasmota! (there is an openbeken project to provide a tasmota-similar cloud cutter https://github.com/openshwprojects/OpenBK7231T_App).
